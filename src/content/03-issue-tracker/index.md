Issues can allow sharing and discussion of proposals before, and during, their implementation between:

They can also be used for a variety of other purposes, customized to your needs and workflow.
Issues are always associated with a specific project, but if you have multiple projects in a group, you can also view all the issues collectively at the group level.

- You and your team.
- Outside collaborators.


---

Common use cases include:

- Discussing the implementation of a new idea
- Tracking tasks and work status
- Accepting feature proposals, questions, support requests, or bug reports
- Elaborating on new code implementations
